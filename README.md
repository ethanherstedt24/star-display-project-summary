# Star Display Project (CSC 202 â€“ Data Structures)

## Overview
The **Star Display Project** was completed as part of CSC 202 (Data Structures) at Augustana College. The project applied object-oriented programming principles in Java to design a program that generates and displays stars with different attributes (size, brightness, and position). The focus was on using inheritance, polymorphism, and data structures to manage star objects and render them efficiently.

## Objectives
- Gain hands-on experience with object-oriented design and Java programming.  
- Implement and manipulate data structures (lists, stacks, and queues).  
- Apply inheritance and polymorphism to extend base classes and add functionality.  
- Practice building a program from design to testing with incremental development.  

## Features
- Randomized generation of stars with varying characteristics.  
- Use of inheritance to define different star types.  
- Dynamic storage and retrieval of stars using Java collections.  
- Console-based rendering of star patterns for visual representation.  

## Skills & Concepts Practiced
- **Java Programming:** OOP, inheritance, polymorphism  
- **Data Structures:** lists, queues, stacks  
- **Algorithmic problem solving**  
- **Program design, debugging, and testing**
